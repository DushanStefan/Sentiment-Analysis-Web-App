# Sentiment Analysis Project

Sentiment analysis leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to determine the emotional tone or sentiment behind textual data. The project focuses on analyzing and categorizing opinions expressed in text as positive or negative. This is a crucial tool in areas such as customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and opinion mining.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. Build a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
2. Create a user-friendly web application to showcase the sentiment analysis results.
3. Deploy the solution to Azure for real-world accessibility.

### Dataset

We will use a pre-labeled dataset containing text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels.

### Steps to Complete the Project

#### 1. Data Collection and Exploration
- Download the dataset from Kaggle.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the text by removing special characters, stopwords, and applying techniques like tokenization and stemming.
- **Build Vocabulary**: Identify unique words or tokens present in the dataset.
- **Vectorization**: Transform text into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Handle Imbalanced Dataset**: Apply oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting techniques if needed.

#### 3. Model Building
Experiment with multiple machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

#### 5. Build Prediction Pipeline
Create a pipeline to preprocess input text and generate sentiment predictions using the trained model.

#### 6. Build Web Application
Develop a web interface for users to input text and view sentiment predictions in real time.

#### 7. Deploy to Azure
Host the web application on Microsoft Azure to make it accessible to users globally.

### Deliverables
1. Sentiment Analysis Model.
2. Web Application for Sentiment Prediction.
3. Documentation and Deployment on Azure.
